<h1>enomic- A game of hacking heroes and villains</h1>

<p>A weekend hack inspired by the <a href="http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm">nomic game</a> and some of the comments on last week's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10056705">hacker news post</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/enomic/enomic">code on Github</a></p>

<p><b>enomic is a self-governing web game that allows its players to modify and evolve the code and rules.</b></p>

<p>This is a minimal implementation of the game. If the objectives are met, enomic could grow into a massive democratic communication app, not unlike wikipedia.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allow anybody to become a player, regardless of location, device, or physical disability</li>
<li>Provide a free communication tool that allows players to voice their opinions and stories</li>
<li>Implement education tools and content to educate players so they can vote effectively</li>
<li>All rules and code should be freely available. Always strive for transparency</li>
<li>Stand secure against villains who attempt to attack the game and detract from the objectives</li>
<li>Offer a reliable reputation system to distinguish heroes from villains</li>
<li>Build auth layers with other apps to cross-verify players' identity and external reputation</li>
<li>The game should hold regular elections to vote on keyholders and heros</li>
<li>Code and rules should be consistent, readable, secure, and durable</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<h3>Players</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get node or io.js</li>
<li>Fork and clone the <a href="https://github.com/enomic/enomic">github repository</a></li>
<li>Install dependencies with `npm install`</li>
<li>Run the app with `npm run server`</li>
<li>Edit ANY of the code or rules- It's your job to accomplish the objectives!</li>
<li>If you don't know where to start, look through the issues on github</li>
<li>Commit with git, push to your fork</li>
<li>Make pull request. Discuss on github to get approved</li>
<li>Rebase regularly so the PR can be automatically merged</li>
</ul>

<h3>Heroes</h3>
<p>To become a hero:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run `node init.js` to generate your key pair</li>
<li>Introduce yourself in a PR that adds your public key to the `heroIds.txt` file</li>
</ul>

<p>To sign code and get it deployed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the pull request commit hash</li>
<li>Sign the hash: `node sign.js &ltcommit_hash&gt`</li>
<li>Comment on the pull request with "#approve &ltsignature&gt"</li>
<li>If the commit can be merged without conflicts, the game will merge and deploy the PR</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keyholder</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can commit directly to the repo</li>
<li>Use gmail account, heroku, and github logins to maintain the release server and keep the main site online</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Rules & Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>1. All players, heros, and keyholders must contribute toward achieving the objctives</li>
<li>2. The game is won when all the objectives have been fufilled. The game never ends and it is possible to un-win. If the game gets broken or corrupted, that is a loose</li>
<li>3. "Villains" are negligent or clearly working against the objectives. Their rights should be stripped</li>
<li>4. Heroes have the ability to approve changes to the rules, objectives, and source code. They should only approve changes that comply with the rules and work towards the objectives</li>
<li>5. Heroes can remove and add other heros by modifying `heroIds.txt`</li>
<li>6. Anything that is technically possible is a legal move. These rules are only guidelines and documentation</li>
<li>8. Keyholders have access to the GitHub, Heroku, and Gmail "enomic" accounts. If a villain succeeds in taking over or breaking the app, the keyholders can take control and fix/reboot the game</li>
</ul>
