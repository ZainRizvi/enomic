# Guidelines


1. All players, heros, and keyholders must contribute toward achieving the objctives
2. The game is won when all the objectives have been fufilled. The game never ends and it is possible to un-win. If the game gets broken or corrupted, that is a loose
3. "Villains" are negligent or clearly working against the objectives. Their rights should be stripped
4. Heroes have the ability to approve changes to the rules, objectives, and source code. They should only approve changes that comply with the rules and work towards the objectives
5. Heroes can remove and add other heros by modifying `heroIds.txt`
6. Anything that is technically possible is a legal move. These rules are only guidelines and documentation
8. Keyholders have access to the GitHub, Heroku, and Gmail "enomic" accounts. If a villain succeeds in taking over or breaking the app, the keyholders can take control and fix/reboot the game
